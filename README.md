## Features

1. MQTT v3.1.1/v5.0 client support (async only)
2. High performance and less memory footprint (see [Benchmark](#benchmark))
3. Customizable topic routing (see [Topic Routing](#topic-routing))
4. Customizable connectivity method (built-in `tcp`, `tcp-tls`, `websocket`, `websocket-tls`)
5. Multiple Builtin session persist methods (see [Session Persist](#session-persist))
6. Idiomatic Go

## Usage

### Prerequisite

- Go 1.9+

### Steps

**TL;DR:** You can find a full example at [examples/client.go](./examples/client.go)

1. Go get this project

	```bash
	go get github.com/goiiot/libmqtt
	```

2. Import this package in your project file

	```go
	import "github.com/goiiot/libmqtt"
	```

3. Create a custom client

	```go
	// Create a client and enable auto reconnect when connection lost
	// We primarily use `RegexRouter` for client
	client, err := libmqtt.NewClient(
		// enable keepalive (10s interval) with 20% tolerance
		libmqtt.WithKeepalive(10, 1.2),
		// enable auto reconnect and set backoff strategy
		libmqtt.WithAutoReconnect(true),
		libmqtt.WithBackoffStrategy(time.Second, 5*time.Second, 1.2),
		// use RegexRouter for topic routing if not specified
		// will use TextRouter, which will match full text
		libmqtt.WithRouter(libmqtt.NewRegexRouter()),
	)

	if err != nil {
		// handle client creation error
		panic("create mqtt client failed")
	}
	```

	__Notice__:

	- If you would like to explore all the options available, please refer to [GoDoc#Option](https://godoc.org/github.com/goiiot/libmqtt#Option)
	- All `Option` can be both global option to all connections the client will have and option to some specific connection

4. Connect to the mqtt broker, then you are ready to pub/sub with server

	```go
	// connect to a mqtt broker
	client.ConnectServer("test.mosquitto.org:8883",
		// use trusted certificate
		libmqtt.WithCustomTLS(nil),
		// handle conn failure
		libmqtt.WithConnHandleFunc(func(client libmqtt.Client, server string, code byte, err error) {
			if err != nil {
				// failed due to network error
				panic(err)
			}
			
			if code != libmqtt.CodeSuccess {
				// rejected by mqtt broker
				panic(code)
			}

			// you are now connected to the broker
			// start your business logic here

			// subscribe some topic(s)
			client.Subscribe([]*libmqtt.Topic{
				{Name: "foo"},
				{Name: "bar", Qos: libmqtt.Qos1},
			}...)

			// publish some topic message(s)
			client.Publish([]*libmqtt.PublishPacket{
				{TopicName: "foo", Payload: []byte("bar"), Qos: libmqtt.Qos0},
				{TopicName: "bar", Payload: []byte("foo"), Qos: libmqtt.Qos1},
			}...)
		}),
	)
	```

5. Unsubscribe from topic(s)

   ```go
   client.Unsubscribe("foo", "bar")
   ```

6. Destroy the client when you would like to

   ```go
   // use true for a immediate disconnect to server
   // use false to send a DisConn packet to server before disconnect
   client.Destroy(true)
   ```

## Topic Routing

Routing topics is one of the most important thing when it comes to business logic, we currently have built two `TopicRouter`s which is ready to use, they are `TextRouter` and `RegexRouter`

- `TextRouter` will match the exact same topic which was registered to client by `Handle` method. (this is the default router in a client)
- `RegexRouter` will go through all the registered topic handlers, and use regular expression to test whether that is matched and should dispatch to the handler

If you would like to apply other routing strategy to the client, you can provide this option when creating the client

```go
client, err := libmqtt.NewClient(
    // ...
    // e.g. use `RegexRouter`
    libmqtt.WithRouter(libmqtt.NewRegexRouter()),
    // ...
)
```

## Session Persist

Per MQTT Specification, session state should be persisted and be recovered when next time connected to server without clean session flag set, currently we provide persist method as following:

1. `NonePersist` - no session persist
2. `memPersist` - in memory session persist
3. `filePersist` - files session persist (with write barrier)

__Note__: Use `RedisPersist` if possible.

## Benchmark

The procedure of the benchmark is:

1. Create the client
2. Connect to server
3. Publish N times to topic `foo`
4. Unsubscribe topic (just ensure all pub message has been sent)
5. Destroy client (without disconnect packet)

The benchmark result listed below was taken on a MacBook Pro 13' (Early 2015, macOS 10.13.2), statistics inside which is the value of ten times average

| Bench Name                              | Pub Count | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |

| BenchmarkPahoClient-4    (eclipse paho) | 100000    | 25072 | 816  | 15        |
